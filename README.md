# extra4

Supplements to the Lean 4 [Standard Library](https://github.com/leanprover/std4).

All components are unstable but feel free to use whatever you need for your own project!

## Purpose

This is a miscellaneous repository of code that, for a variety of reasons, neither belonged in the standard library nor in development code. 
Ideally, everything in here will find its way elsewhere in due time.

That said: this is not a code dump!
All the code in here is curated and should abide by coding standards from the Lean 4 Standard Library.
Pull requests are very welcome but they will be carefully reviewed before merging.
